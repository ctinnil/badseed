BadSeed is an open source macOS framework for digital forensics and penetration testing. The project is based on open source and commercial tools, used in the industry, that are maintained by their authors. To summarise, BadSeed offers a full portable laboratory for all kinds of cyber security operations, ranging from pentesting to digital forensics and reverse engineering, but it also includes everything needed to develop your own software or keep your data secure. All the tools included may only be used with proper authorisation backed-up by a Rules of Engagement (RoE) agreement or for educational purposes in laboratories and virtual environments. Performing hack attempts on computers that you do not own, without written permission from owners, is illegal. The information contained in this repository should only be used to enhance the security of your IT infrastructure and not to conduct malicious or damaging attacks. You should not misuse this information to gain unauthorised access into computer systems. I will not be responsible for any direct or indirect damage caused due to the misusage of the provided framework.
